# Automatic Enrollment Bot
The automatic enrollment bot enables students to specify (full) courses that they'd like to enroll in. When there is an availability, the bot will automatically enroll the student in the course and send them a mobile notification upon successful enrollment. 

# Features
- Checking every few seconds to see if the course has an available spot. The time can be modified to increase the amount of checks per minute.
- Send mobile notifications to the user if the bot successfully enrolled the student in the course or if the bot crashed.
